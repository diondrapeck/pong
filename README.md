My implementation of the classic Pong game in C++ playing against a CPU. First player to 5 points wins.

**To Play**
* Clone the repo
* Build and run `main.cpp` in Visual Studio 2022 or the compiler of your choice
* Have fun!

**Editing the game**
* To make the game more challenging: increase `ball.speed_*` variables, decrease `player.speed`, and/or decrease `player.height`.
